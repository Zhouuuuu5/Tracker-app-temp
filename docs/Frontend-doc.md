#  HateCrimeTrack-App  Front-End  Doc

Developers can follow up the documents to pre-view the extension and maintain the project quickly before implementing the project.

#  Resources

We have compiled a list of external resources that were used in the development of this project. To make it easier for you to learn more about these resources, we have included links to their official documentation.

***For  developers:**  Please  utilize  the  already-integrated  packages  listed  below  before  adding  new  packages,  as  adding  too  many  packages  can  increase  app  size,  complexity,  and  the  risk  of  conflicts  and  errors.*

#  Component  Usage

This section provides an overview of the components used in the front-end interface in the app. We will provide a list of each component used along with the corresponding React Native package it belongs to. This will give you an idea of what packages we have used and what components you can find in each package.
